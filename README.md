# NUKE TOOLS

Welcome to the repository of various tools and toolsets I've gathered over the years. These tools, some of which I've crafted myself, are here for the world to benefit from, speeding up workflows and enhancing efficiency.

## RotoLayerQC

Have you ever worked in the roto and paint QC world? I developed this QC tool during my time as a Paint & Roto Artist. After countless discussions and hands-on experience, the tool evolved, and new functionalities were added. It's now a reliable group node that's shared across vendors and departments worldwide.

This tool is primarily designed to assist with edge quality control and perform basic premultiplication overlays. It's also aligned with a naming convention that's compatible with extraction workflows, including depth, type, and matte passes.

## VoronoiTextureExtractor

Behold the VoronoiTextureExtractor!

With the incredible help of DasGrain and the latest implementation of blinkscript's voronoi pattern generation, we've unlocked the ability to crop a 2D part of an image and elegantly Tile/Scatter it around. Seriously, why isn't there a tile+scatter (texturize) option in nuke? Am I missing something?

Feel free to ask about or explore these tools further!
